# caddy-imagebrowser

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A small HTML template file with a built-in image browser and a grid layout.

The image browser unfortunately requires JavaScript. Without JavaScript, the
page will behave similarly to how the default browse template behaves.

## Usage

See example [Caddyfile](./Caddyfile).
